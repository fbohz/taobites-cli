<font size="5">The tao that can be <code><b>tar</b></code>(1)ed<br>
is not the entire Tao.<br>
The PATH that can be specified <br>
is not the full PATH.<br>
<br>
We declare the names<br>
of all variables and functions.<br>
Yet the Tao has no type specifier.<br>
<br>
Dynamically binding, you realize the magic.<br>
Statically binding, you see only the hierarchy.<br>
<br>
Yet magic and hierarchy<br>
arise from the same source,<br>
and this source has a null pointer.<br>
<br>
Reference the NULL within NULL,<br>
it is the gateway to all wizardry.<br> </p>
</font><h2><font size="5">2</font></h2> <p id="2">
<font size="5">When users see one GUI as beautiful,<br>
other user interfaces become ugly.<br>
When users see some programs as winners,<br>
other programs become lossage.<br>
<br>
Pointers and NULLs reference each other.<br>
High level and assembler depend on each other.<br>
Double and float cast to each other.<br>
High-endian and low-endian define each other.<br>
While and until follow each other.<br>
<br>
Therefore the Coder <br>
programs without doing anything<br>
and teaches without saying anything.<br>
Warnings arise and he lets them come;<br>
processes are swapped and he lets them go.<br>
He has but doesn't <code><b>chown</b></code>,<br>
acts but doesn't <code><b>expect</b></code>.<br>
When his work is done, he deletes it.<br>
That is why it lasts forever.<br></p>

<font size="5">When you overesteem great hackers,<br>
more users become cretins.<br>
When you develop encryption,<br>
more users become crackers.<br>
<br>
The Coder leads<br>
by emptying user's minds<br>
and increasing their quotas,<br>
by weakening their ambition<br>
and toughening their resolve.<br>
When users lack knowledge and desire,<br>
management will not try to interfere.<br>
<br>
Practice not-looping,<br>
and everything will fall into place.<br></p>

I don't know who built it.<br>
It came before the first kernel.<br></p>

<font size="5">The Tao doesn't take sides;<br>
it gives birth to both wins and losses.<br>
The Coder doesn't take sides;<br>

<br>
The Tao is like a stack:<br>
the data changes but not the structure.<br>
the more you use it, the deeper it becomes;<br>
the more you talk of it, the less you understand.<br>

Hold on to the root.<br></p>

Contiguous, unpatchable,<br>

From there it includes all formulas,<br>
an image without a viewer,<br>
virtual, beyond all conception.<br>

Rewind it and there is no beginning;<br>
Fast forward and there is no end.<br>
You can't know it, but you can be it,<br>

<font size="5">The ancient Wizards were profound and subtle.<br>
Their wisdom was unfathomable.<br>
There is no way to describe it;<br>

They were careful<br>
as someone writing an unbuffered stream.<br>
Alert as a warrior in a dangerous MUD.<br>
Courteous as an anonymous ftp.<br>
Fluid as a morphing face.<br>
Shapable as an interpolated spline.<br>
Receptive as a dialup slip connection.<br>
Clear as a sharpened bitmap.<br>

Do you have the patience to wait<br>
till the broadcast storm subsides and the web is clear?<br>
Can you mask interrupts <br>

The Coder doesn't seek fulfillment.<br>
Not seeking, not throwing exceptions,<br>

If you don't trust the users,<br>

The Coder doesn't talk, he hacks.<br>

The Coder does his job<br>

He understands that the web<br>
